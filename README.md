# ScaleDown: Optimize AI prompts to reduce verbosity and carbon footprint
### Presentation: [{ YOUR PRESENTATION NAME }](workshop/presentation_template.pdf)

## Workshop description
During this workshop, you will learn how to leverage the ScaleDown Python package to optimize AI prompts, reduce token usage, and minimize your AI applications' carbon footprint. 

We'll explore practical techniques for creating structured templates, implementing model-specific optimizations, and measuring environmental impact. 

You'll gain hands-on experience with the package's key features while understanding how even small efficiency improvements can lead to significant cost savings and environmental benefits when adopted at scale.
